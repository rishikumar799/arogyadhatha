2.  **Quick Access:** From the dashboard, the user can tap on any icon to navigate directly to a specific feature, such as "AI Symptom Checker" or "Appointments."
3.  **Feature Interaction:**
    *   If a user has symptoms, they navigate to the **AI Symptom Checker**, describe their issue, and get an analysis that might lead them to the **Appointments** page to book a consultation with a recommended specialist.
    *   If a user needs to manage their daily health, they can go to the **Health Tracker** or **My Medicines** pages.
    *   For existing appointments, the **Chat & OPD Queue** provides live updates on their token number and wait time.
4.  **Footer Navigation:** A scrollable navigation bar at the bottom of the screen provides persistent access to all key features from anywhere in the app, making it easy to switch between tasks without returning to the dashboard.
