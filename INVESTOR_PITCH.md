## Healthcare is Fragmented and Inefficient

For millions in India, managing health is a stressful, disjointed experience.

*   **Fragmented System:** Patients juggle multiple apps and paper records for appointments, reports, and prescriptions. There is no single source of truth.
*   **Lack of Guidance:** Getting immediate, reliable advice is difficult. Users either self-diagnose with unreliable information or face long waits for a consultation.
*   **Reactive Care:** The system is built for treating sickness, not promoting wellness. Patients lack the tools to proactively manage their health.
*   **Wasted Time & Money:** Inefficient processes lead to long waiting times at clinics, unnecessary consultations, and delays in care.
